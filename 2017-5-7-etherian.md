 Token and Status: The BAT also has attention-based applicability inside the Ethereum-based messaging/payment platforms such as Coinbase’s   new Token app and Status app."

##### [Casper](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/) (Dev Channel) – Proof of Stake Protocol  
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics](https://badges.gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics.svg)](https://gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)  
- Section 2.2.3 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5694) was suggested as a reference for researching bribe attack security (by @iddo333)
- Iddo and Loi will be actively working on a solution to avoid exit-scam risk after Metropolis. (That or a proof-of-steak pun, it was unclear but I'm assuming it's not the pun).
- Currently the first validator sets the current epoch and increments the dynasty, in the future this should be hard-forked in as part of block initialization.
- The question of forming a cartel by kicking off inactive participants has been getting thrown around for a while. Both Vitalik and Vlad have suggested increasing the cost of absenteeism to solve this but differ on the numbers, Vitalik suggested 20% while Vlad suggested 50%.
- [List of Ethereum research topics](https://hackmd.io/MwJgJmDswIxgtMApgIwKzwCxoBzHjgMYo7wCcSmSIOKJkAhgAxA=?both) to show potential collaborators, from Virgil Griffith.
- Vitalik says [this](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) is the only repo that matters now, no need to pay attention to older ones.

- Blog Post: [Digix Dev Update — May 7th 2017](https://medium.com/@Digix/digix-dev-update-may-7th-2017-b3f94e3f9c3f)
- Re: Marketing via the TokenCard ICO
  >KC Chng: "Henry. To be fair, this is a decision not made, nor decided by us, nor did we wake up one day deciding this was for marketing. If a group of users decided to run an Ico with dgds for example, then we are glad if they told us and we will do our best to let others know. Thanks"
- Some good advice courtesy of Tayvano from MEW on the best course of action if you are a victim of scamming/phishing:
  > Tayvano: "Definitely comment on all the explorers and reach out to exchanges if it ends up there. It's unlikely you'll get your money back but it doesn't hurt. The circle of scammers \phishers is surprisingly small and tend to reuse addresses. You never know when your piece of info helps connect the dots to someone who is mapping it in the future."
- **Development of the Digix Core Contracts (2.0) is complete and ready for Kovan deployment!**
- Important note on DGD rewards: 
  > KC Chng: "There are no dividends in the sense of a passive stream of income. Once governance is out, dgd holders will need to vet and approve / reject proposals before they can claim their rewards for their work done. The rewards come from the dgx token protocol, which sends 0.13% of txn fees and 0.2%pa of the demurrage fees to DigixDao."
- 100% of DGX transaction fees go to DGD. *Demurrage distribution, on the other hand, is .2 to DGD and .4 to the Pte Ltd (to cover storage/auditing costs).*
- Currently Spectrum only supports Legder Nano.

- We should be getting a dev update soon.
- On other methods of payment in FirstBlood:
  >Marco Cuesta: "Hi vol_har ! You will  be able to use other methods of payment to risk on a match in the future. If you would like to organize tournaments, run witness nodes, be a juror, or receive referral rewards you will need to be a 1ST holder. 1ST is a utility token that you need to interact with many of the features on our platform. Opening up other methods of payment for gamers will be an even larger benefit for 1ST holders because there will be more matches on our system."

- Some devs are running into problems on the iOS version that they are not having in the Android version. This problem seems to be stemming from converting the MNID to an ethereum address. Try using [this library](https://github.com/uport-project/mnid) if you're having this problem. (Thanks to Michael Shihjay Chen, MD for bringing up the issue).
